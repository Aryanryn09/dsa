Welcome to my repository of solved LeetCode questions! This repository serves as a way for me to document and keep track of my progress as I work through various algorithmic and data structures problems on LeetCode.

The repository contains solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems, including both easy and hard questions from different categories such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more.

Each solution includes a brief description of the problem statement, the solution in Java or Python, and a detailed explanation of the thought process and algorithm used. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for anyone looking to improve their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out or open an issue in the repository. Happy coding!"
